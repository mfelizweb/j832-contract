# J832 Protocol — Smart Contracts

Open-source Solidity contract for J832 Protocol: tamper-proof audit trails and multi-admin governance for blockchain applications.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the Solidity smart contract powering the J832 Protocol.  
**J832Protocol** enables organizations and applications to log critical changes on-chain, enforce multi-admin approval, and provide an immutable audit trail for compliance and transparency.

- Multi-admin support (role-based access)
- On-chain log of changes and actions
- Designed for auditability and governance in Web3 systems
- Compatible with all EVM chains
