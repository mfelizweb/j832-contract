# J832 Protocol — Smart Contracts

Open-source Solidity contract for J832 Protocol: tamper-proof audit trails and multi-admin governance for blockchain applications.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the Solidity smart contract powering the J832 Protocol.  
**J832Protocol** enables organizations and applications to log critical changes on-chain, enforce multi-admin approval, and provide an immutable audit trail for compliance and transparency.

- Multi-admin support (role-based access)
- On-chain log of changes and actions
- Designed for auditability and governance in Web3 systems
- Compatible with all EVM chains

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies


npm install

const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
  console.log("Deploying contract with the account:", deployer.address);

  const J832Protocol = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("J832Protocol");
  const j832 = await J832Protocol.deploy();
  await j832.waitForDeployment();  

  console.log("J832Protocol deployed to:", await j832.getAddress());
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});

## abi/ # ABI JSON 
The ABI is auto-generated after compiling the contract.  
You can find it at `artifacts/contracts/J832Protocol.sol/J832Protocol.json`  
or copy it to `/abi/` for easy SDK or front-end integration.


## Contract Features

- **registerChange** — Log an action/change with data and cryptographic signature.
- **createResource** — Create a new resource/entity on-chain.
- **addAdmin / removeAdmin** — Manage multi-admin access and permissions.
- **getChanges** — Retrieve audit logs for a resource.


## Security & Best Practices

- **Never commit or expose private keys, .env files, or sensitive data in this repository.**
- Always deploy to a testnet before mainnet.
- Review and test all contract logic carefully before production use.
- Follow [Solidity security best practices](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access).

If you find a vulnerability or issue, please open an issue or contact the maintainer.
